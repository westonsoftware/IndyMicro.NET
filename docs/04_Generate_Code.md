## CHAPTER 04

# Generate Code

#### Create the server projects

After completing the [installation steps](03_Getting_Started), you are ready to generate your own solution.  The following commands use the project name ***Sample*** with a new module named ***Clock*** but you can use any valid namespace names of your own.

```
md Sample
cd Sample
dotnet new indymicro-infrastructure -n Sample.Infrastructure
dotnet new indymicro-context -n Sample.Context
dotnet new indymicro-host -n Sample.Host
dotnet new indymicro-module -n Sample.Module.Clock --ModuleName Clock
dotnet new sln Sample
dotnet sln add Sample.Host
dotnet sln add Sample.Infrastructue
dotnet sln add Sample.Context
dotnet sln add Sample.Module.Clock
```

- In the Clock project, check the references to your Infrastructure and Context projects.
- In the Host project, check the references to your Infrastructure and Context projects.  For debugging, it is also much easier to add a reference to the Clock module project as well so go ahead and do that.  (For production, you can load modules dynamically instead of linking to the host like this.)
- In the Host project, find the *appsettings.json* file and review the settings.  Your Clock module settings will use sqlite for the DatabaseType by default.

```
dotnet build
dotnet run
```

You should now be able to see server output in the console.  

You can aslo check your API document generated by swagger like this:
